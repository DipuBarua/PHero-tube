            <p>
                var: var is a declaration system of variable. globally we can initialize a variable using var from any
                where even after console we can declar variable using var. but in let and const we have initialize
                variable.
            <h3>
                EX:
                m =44;
                console.log(m);
                var m = 43;
                //output >> 44
            </h3>
            </p>
            <P>
                let: let is a kind of declaration way (data or variable type) which allows to change the value of a
                variable continously. which is helpful to continue a loop.
            <h3>
                Ex:
                let y = 4;
                y=2;
                console.log(y);
                //output >> 2
            </h3>
            </P>
            <p>
                const: const is a declaration way where values of a variable are fixed. we can't change or set new
                values after initial declaration.
                it is a kind of constant value after first declaration. That is why const can create error in loop.
                Though, it is better except continous value changing variable like in loop.
            </p>
            <h3>
                EX:
                const x =10;
                x=3;
                console.log(x);
                // output >> TypeError
            </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="text-2xl bg-gray-200">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
            <p>
                NULL:
                when we want to get null value from a variable, we can set null.
            <h3>
                EX:
                let x = 32;
                x = null;
                console.log(x);
                // output >> null
            </h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                UNDEFINED:
                In function, without return if we try to get function result from out of function scope, we must get
                undefined.
            <h3>
                EX:
                function num(a){
                console.log(a);
                }
                console.log(num(4));
                //output >> 4 undefined
            </h3>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="text-2xl bg-gray-200">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
            <p>
                API: application programming interface. api work like a middle man between server site and user site. when user send a request to get required data then API receive the request and fetch the required data from server and then send to clien site.
                this API system works on depending promise function. That is why some time API has failed to fetch data. such as: if i lose the internet connection, at the meantime of running API system, definitely API will failed to fetch data.
                
                <h3>
                    Ex: API works like a waiter in resturant. customers order food(data),waiter(API) receive the order then waiter go to kitchen(server) and then come to customers with food.
